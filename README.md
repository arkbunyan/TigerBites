## Project Description

TigerBites is a web application designed to connect the Princeton University community to the off-campus dining scene. Through our application, users will be able to find quick recommendations for places to eat based on cravings, price point, and location preferences. You'll be able to see a summary of restaurants’ menu items, read through reviews left by fellow campus diners, and get directions to the restaurant that will best satisfy your cravings in the moment. We hope that this application will encourage students to explore all the amazing dining options Princeton has to offer!

To host website run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
npm run builddev
python -m backend.runserver [port #]
